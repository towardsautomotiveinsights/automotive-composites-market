## Industry Trends

### Growing Demand for Lightweight Materials

The automotive industry’s increasing demand for lightweight materials is driving the growth of the automotive composites market. Lightweight composites, such as carbon fiber and fiberglass, offer significant advantages, especially in terms of strength-to-weight ratios. These composites are highly sought after to enhance vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, and overall sustainability.

### Advancements in Hybrid Composites

Hybrid composites, combining the strengths of different materials, are creating new opportunities in the automotive sector. These composites are typically made by blending fibers such as carbon, glass, or aramid with thermoplastics or other resins. The result is improved mechanical properties, such as enhanced strength, durability, and weight reduction. These innovations allow automakers to produce components that are not only lighter but also stronger and more resilient than traditional materials.

### Performance and Design Enhancements

Automotive composites offer significant performance and design enhancements. Benefits include weight reduction, improved strength-to-weight ratios, noise and vibration damping, high corrosion resistance, and energy absorption. Additionally, composites provide design flexibility, enabling the optimization of aerodynamics, parts consolidation, and customizable properties. For example, in March 2025, Industrial Summit Technology (I.S.T.) unveiled IMIDETEX, a super fiber designed to enhance composite performance in the automotive industry.

### Utilization of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) in the EV Industry

CFRP materials are known for their low thermal expansion, high strength-to-weight ratio, superior corrosion resistance, and high tensile strength. These properties make CFRP an ideal choice in the EV industry to reduce weight and improve performance. In April 2024, Hyundai Motor Group and Toray Industries Inc. collaborated to develop a new range of lightweight, high-strength CFRP for electric vehicles.
